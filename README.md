# tidytuesdayapi

This is a web API for the 
 [Tidy Tuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) project.
Tidy Tuesday is a "weekly data project aimed at the R ecosystem."
Each week a new data set is released and participants practice their data
 science skills.

This project offers access to the Tidy Tuesday data sets through a web API.
R users may be interested in the package 
 [tidytuesdayR](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidytuesdayR/index.html)
 which provides an R interface to the data sets as well as other helpful 
 information.
The aim with this project is to provide an interface for users of other 
 programming language.
 
 
 ## Warning: WIP
 
 This is very much a work in progress.
 It's highly experimental at this stage.
